   API
     Application Programming Interface. A set of routines, procedures, protocols, and tools for building software applications.

   Coverage
     A type of spatial data that represents different values at different locations. Satellite imagery, aerial photography, and digital elevation models (DEMs) are examples of coverage data.

   CRS
     Coordinate reference system. The combination of a geographic and projected coordinate systems that define how two-dimensional maps relate to locations on the earth's surface. Geographic coordinate systems use a three-dimensional spherical surface to define those locations, referencing points on that surface through angles (latitude and longitude values) measured from the earth's center. Projected coordinate systems are based on flat two-dimensional surfaces, with locations referenced by x, y coordinates measured as constant lengths and distances across that surface. See also :term:`SRID` and :term:`SRS`.

   Data Store
     A GeoServer data store represents a connection to a source of raster or vector data, such as a file or group of files, a database table, and so on.

   KML
     Keyhole Markup Language. This is the spatial :term:`XML` format used by Google Earth. Google Earth was originally written by a company named "Keyhole", hence the (now obscure) reference in the name.

   Mosaic
     A collection of georeferenced raster data sources merged together to create a seamless raster dataset. See also :term:`ImageMosaic`.

   Projection
     A method of representing the earth's three-dimensional surface on a two-dimensional plan. See also :term:`CRS`.

   Scalable Vector Graphics
     This is a family of specifications of an :term:`XML`-based file format for describing two-dimensional vector graphics, both static and dynamic (i.e. interactive or animated). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics.

   Raster Layer
     A published GeoServer representation of raster format data stored as a cell-based representation of features on the earth surface.
